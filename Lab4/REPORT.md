# LAB 4 REPORT
## INTRODUCTION

 The focus of this fourth lab lies on creating the Java classes outlined in Seminar 4, with particular emphasis on the execution of the Comparable interface implementation. The main objective is to devise a system 
 to sort both league tables and goal scorers. We will also implement a Dictionary to work with the stats. Finally implment printing methods for league tables and goal scorers.

 ### Sorting League Tables:
 Depending on the results of the matches, each teams is sorted with the best teams at the top. The criteria we will use is the general one in football: Win= 3 points, Tie = 1 point, Loss = 0 points.
 So we order the teams comparing their points were the best tems have the most. In case 2 teams are tied in points we first compare the goal difference in all the games they have independetly played (goalsFor- goalsAgainst). If 2 teams are tied in both points and goal difference, we pritoerize the team with more goals scored.

 ### Implementation Comparable:
 
 ### Sorting  Goal Scorers:

 ### Implementation Dictionary:

 ### Printing Goal Scorers & League Table:
